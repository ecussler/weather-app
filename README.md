Coding Bootcamp Challenge #6 - Server Side APIs

## Description

This project used server-side APIs to create a web based weather app while also using our knowledge of JavaScript and local storage. This app includes: 

- Use of the Open Weather API to fetch current and five-day forecasts. 
- Locally stored search items that will render on the page after refresh.  
- Dynamically added elements and event listeners. 

This project challenging but fun. There were a couple of sticky spots for me (namely the five-day forecast) but I with time, I know I can get these to function properly and look nice.  


## Installation

NA


## Usage

This application is for functional use and for future employers to see the progress I've made with not only server-side APIs but also in my JavaScript.
